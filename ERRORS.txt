 ===> Make sure that paper PDFs use the Libertinus font family; instructions to install Libertinus fonts are included in https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEUR-Template-1col.odt; paper PDFs should all use Libertinus fonts, prefaces that have no paper character do not necessarily need to use Libertinus; do not use Word/MS365 but rather use LibreOffice and its PDF exporter
